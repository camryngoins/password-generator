# Password Generator

## Description
- As the third challenge for my coding bootcamp, I was given the task of creating a password generator using javascript. I started by using pseudocode to map out exactly what I needed to do, so that I could use step by step instructions for myself and make it a little easier for me to figure out what exactly I needed to do.
- I then went ahead and created the password length prompt, making sure that the user only selected a character length between 8-128, and if the user tried to make it any number less than 8 or any number greater than 129 it would give them an error and have them start over to follow the prompt correctly. I did this using conditional statements.
- Then in my "else" section I made sure to prompt questions to user, asking them if they wanted to use uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers or any special characters.
- After this, I used more conditional statements to predict various outcomes that the user could select. If they chose to skip all the prompts, it would give them an error telling them they needed to select an option, and then if they chose to select all prompts or any other possible outcomes, the password generator then generated a unique password for them based off of what they selected.
- Then I used the "for" loop to actually excute the code!
